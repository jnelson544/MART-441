Week 3 Assignment
My successes, challenges, and how I overcame them when creating my adventure story.

I struggled with thinking of a concept. I wasn't really sure what kind of adventure I could come up with that 
would grab a persons attention. I decided to work with an idea as common as adventure stories come. I chose a 
story about a family's hike through the woods. Once I started creating the various options for each step along
 the journey, I relaized how quickly that exponential growth had over taken my code. 
I got lost several times in my code and had to step back and assess which choices I had already coded. I had
to draw up several graphs to map out how my choices affected the story. I realized early on that I had the 
ability to use 1 option for 2 different choices, so I began implementing "if" statements that included
&& and || arguements, however that also came with its challenges. If the information was wrong, the choice
will simple give me the wrong page. This made the debugging process difficult, but I was able to fix all
my bugs. My successes included the implementation on the prompt() function which allows the adventurer 
to enter there name. I have added it to appear within the story. I also found a way to change the background
depending on which choice is made. I feel this adds to the fun of the game. I did notice that it got easier
to come up with more twists and turns once I began.
