# MART-441

Homework Week 1 

 This is the very first technical readme report of the semester and I am not entirely certain what it should entail. 
 I followed the instructions given with creating a very simple and basic site about myself. I was not in MART341 and had
 to do some research to find out some of the terms and principles that we required of us this week. 
 I was surprised to see in the reading that Hero Images and the use of Graients are very popular these days. I very much enjoy using gradients and use them quite often in my developing. I struggled with changing each of my sections opacity. I wanted to make the boxes
 more transparent so the background was able to show through a bit more, but unfortunately it would change the text as well which was
 not what I wanted so I had to scrap that idea. I also struggled with the placement of my section buttons and 1 is underlined and 
 formatted like a link, but its formatting matches the other 2 buttons therefore it should not be underlined. I hope that my site is 
 what is expected this week and I look forward to hopefully figureing out what I did wrong.
