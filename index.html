            <h2>My Theme</h2>
            <p> Hello, My name is Jessica Nelson. The theme of my site is adapting to the every changing world we are in much like the Ocean.
                As the ocean's currents rage, roll, twist, and shift, so does society and life as we proceive it. The only constant in life is change. 
                Much like the ocean, there are low moments in life and high moments similar to the ever changing tides. It is important to learn how to 
                remaining standing regardless of the change in tide.

            <h2> A bit about me...</h2>
            <p>I am here at UM to get a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. My major is Software Engineering and I am also working towards a minor in Media Arts. 
                When I started school, I intended to get a certificate in CyberSecurity but realized early on that was not the right path for me. I also 
                discovered along the way that I enjoyed my artistic general education classes. Hence the addition of a minor degree with my major. I found a passion
                within myself for the artistic side of coding and creation. I graduate Spring 2025 and I am excited to see what the future holds. I currently work for
                a casino as a machine technician. My daily tasks involve working with the hardware for these machines and as my schooling progresses, I am not learning 
                more about how the game makers create the games that I work on everyday. It has been an interesting shift in my overall understand of my position. Maybe
                after graduation I will no longer work on the hardware, but rather develope the software. We shall see what happens.

            <h2> Interests</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest things that interests me is Photography. It has been a big hobby of mine for as long as I can remember. I have had several different
                kinds of camera over the years. I tend to be rough on them. It can be dangerous trecking through the woods and across rivers and lakes with your
                DSLR camera straped to your chest. This is how I answer the question regarding what I see when I look at the world. The world can be a troubled and confusing
                place, but when I look at it through my camera lens, the clouds part and the worry fades. Its like being transported to a whole different place. Photography as 
                an art form allows the artists to find the most beautiful things that others may not have even known were there. Just the other day when the weather was rough
                and the tempertures were low, I was able to take the most glorous pictures of a section of the mountains near my house. The mountain is covered in trees and the
                snow crystals have encased the branches like they were chandeliers. It was extremely beautiful. Even in the most trecherous weather, there is beauty and magic. 
                Which further reiterates my theme. Even though times are tough and everything seems negative (including the tempertures outside), there are goods things all 
                around, you just have hold fast, stand firm, and be brave enough to find them.
