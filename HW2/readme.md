Week Assignment
Compare my creation of Homework 2 against Copilot's version of the assignment. 

Copilots version of the assignment looked more like 3 seperate lists with a subheading for each category where i preferred to create a story of sorts
for what my favorites where for each catergory. Cppilot listed each item numerically where as mine lists where not. We both made or websites as active
links. Copilot used only board games in its list where I branched it to seperate forms of games. 
Copilot took the term artist and only listed painters as favorite artists. My artists branched across multiple mediums of the art world.  
Also, I chose to place a background image in my HTML and included a bit extra in my body. Copilot chose a single color and a "Welcome" statement. 

I feel that if I had only used Copilot's output i did not complete the assignment correctly. I used features of Javascript Copilot did not. Copilot 
only used the console.log() command for the entire file. Since part of this weeks requirements was to learn more about JavaScript, I felt it was 
important to demonstrate those JavaScript coding abilities that we learn such as using variables. I do believe the work is still mine if I
used Copilots code because I gave it the parameters for what it needed to create. If my intension was to turn in something Copilot created, 
I would have been much more clear and consise with those parameters. However, I do not feel this Copilot creation is in anyway mine because I copy/paste
directly from the Homework 2 page and fed that into the search bar. The result in this instance is more the Professor's creation that it is mine.
