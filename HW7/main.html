<!-- I started out searching for images of social justice over the internet, but that did not seem to work. I could not find images that told the "story" that i wanted to tell, so I had AI generate them. 
I provide vague prompts about diversity, equality, and inclusion and this is what CoPilot created. I also had some issues with my code so I had ChatGPT help me with debugging. This was not easy because
some of the code suggestions were code that I already had implemented correctly. Also it would start to go round and round with the same answer a few times. It would get stuck in an answer loop so I 
would be unable to get an answer and would have to try to change up my question. Luckily, I was able to make the sit work properly. -->
